Angular training
================================================================

**Goal**:
- Quickly set up an angular app with which you can browse through a list of movies, see movie details and edit these details
- The application must be build with reusable components and have a structure that abides by the de angular styleguide.

**Assignment structure**:
- Each assignment has its own folder in the exercises folder
- An assignment folder contains:
  - An `assignment.md` file where the assigment itself is described.
  - An `steps.md` file that describes the assignment in detailed steps.
  - Sometimes an `explanation.md` file that gives further explanation if needed.
  - Sometimes other files to support the assignment.

An assignment consist of a title, a description in one or two sentences, resource links, steps, sometimes 'extra' steps and a result.
- Advanced 'students' can try to perform the assignment by using only the description and links in stead of following the steps.
- Extra steps are not explained, just a description is given

The assignments are grouped into subjects. each subject will be live coded and explained before the students start doing the assignments.
After a subject, questions can be asked. If a student is done with a subject, he may help other students where possible. subjects:

- subject 1: creating components (list en detail) - > 1 t/m 5
- subject 2: creating a (feature) module -> 
- subject 3: retreiving data with a service (observables) -> 
- subject 4: processing user input with a (reactive form) form ->
- subject 5: routing between multiple features -> 
- subject 6: component (style) encapsulation and shadow DOM ->
- subject 7: organizing application structure (core, shared module) ->
- subject 8: unit testing (the detail component en service) ->

**Todo's & Tips**:
- Try and use the Angular API reference when doing the assignments: [angular 2 api reference](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/)
